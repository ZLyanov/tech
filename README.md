Stack class quiz:
Add a couple methods to our LinkedList class and use that to implement a Stack. You have 4 functions below to fill in: insert_first, delete_first, push, and pop. Think about this while you're implementing: why is it easier to add an "insert_first" function than just use "append"?
Home task:
1.	Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters and prints them in reverse order.  Use a stack.
2.	Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters, and determines whether its parentheses, braces, and curly braces are "balanced."  Hint: for left delimiters, push onto stack; for right delimiters, pop from stack and check whether popped element matches right delimiter.

Queue class quiz:
Make a Queue class using a list! Hint: You can use any Python list method you'd like! Try to write each one in as few lines as possible. Make sure you pass the test cases too! Implement enqueue, peek and dequeue methods.
Home task:
1.	Implement min() and max() methods
2.	Implement a queue with two stacks
